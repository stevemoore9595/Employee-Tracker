# Employee-Tracker

  ## Description

  With this project I learned how to create a logo maker so I can create my own logo and I don't have to pay anyone to do it for me.
  Working on this project helped me understand that it is important to get help if I'm stuck for 20 minutes. I failed to do that when 
  I got stuck, and I lost a lot of hours over issues that I had.
